# ISL Detection

Welcome to the ISL Detection project! This repository contains code and resources for detecting Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that can accurately detect and recognize ISL gestures from images or video input. This can be used to assist in communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing of ISL gesture images
- Implementation of various machine learning models for gesture recognition
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Real-time gesture detection using webcam or video input

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anaymaurya04/ISL_Detection.git
cd ISL_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
